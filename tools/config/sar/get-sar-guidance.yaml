  ## NEO4J EVIDENCE GATHERING QUERIES

  ### 1. Subject Profile and Identity Information

  Gather comprehensive subject information:

      MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: $customerId})
      OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_EMAIL]->(e:Email)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_PHONE]->(p:Phone)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_SSN]->(s:SSN)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_ADDRESS]->(a:Address)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_DRIVER_LICENSE]->(dl:DriverLicense)
      RETURN
        c.customerId AS customerId,
        c.firstName AS firstName,
        c.lastName AS lastName,
        c.dateOfBirth AS dateOfBirth,
        c.createdAt AS accountOpenDate,
        collect(DISTINCT e.address) AS emails,
        collect(DISTINCT p.number) AS phones,
        collect(DISTINCT s.number) AS ssns,
        collect(DISTINCT a.street + ', ' + a.city + ', ' + a.state + ' ' + a.zip) AS addresses,
        collect(DISTINCT dl.number) AS driverLicenses

  ### 2. Transaction History and Patterns

  Get transaction timeline for suspect account(s):

      MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: $customerId})-[:OWNS]->(a:Account)
      MATCH (a)-[t:TRANSACTION]->(target:Account)
      WHERE t.timestamp >= datetime($startDate)
        AND t.timestamp <= datetime($endDate)
      RETURN
        t.timestamp AS transactionDate,
        t.amount AS amount,
        t.type AS transactionType,
        t.description AS description,
        a.accountNumber AS fromAccount,
        target.accountNumber AS toAccount,
        t.location AS location
      ORDER BY t.timestamp DESC
      LIMIT 1000

  ### 3. Synthetic Identity Detection (Shared PII)

  Find other customers sharing identity attributes with suspect:

      MATCH (suspect:Customer {customerId: $customerId})
      MATCH (suspect)-[:HAS_SSN|HAS_EMAIL|HAS_PHONE|HAS_ADDRESS|HAS_DRIVER_LICENSE]->(pii)
      MATCH (other:Customer)-[:HAS_SSN|HAS_EMAIL|HAS_PHONE|HAS_ADDRESS|HAS_DRIVER_LICENSE]->(pii)
      WHERE suspect <> other
      RETURN
        other.customerId AS relatedCustomerId,
        other.firstName + ' ' + other.lastName AS relatedCustomerName,
        labels(pii) AS sharedPIIType,
        CASE
          WHEN 'Email' IN labels(pii) THEN pii.address
          WHEN 'Phone' IN labels(pii) THEN pii.number
          WHEN 'SSN' IN labels(pii) THEN pii.number
          WHEN 'Address' IN labels(pii) THEN pii.street
          WHEN 'DriverLicense' IN labels(pii) THEN pii.number
        END AS sharedValue,
        other.createdAt AS relatedAccountOpenDate
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

  ### 4. Network Analysis (First-Party Fraud Rings)

  Identify transaction networks involving suspect:

      MATCH path = (suspect:Customer {customerId: $customerId})-[:OWNS]->(:Account)
                    -[:TRANSACTION*1..3]-(:Account)<-[:OWNS]-(connected:Customer)
      WHERE suspect <> connected
      WITH connected,
          COUNT(DISTINCT path) AS connectionStrength,
          SUM([rel IN relationships(path) WHERE type(rel) = 'TRANSACTION' | rel.amount][0]) AS totalAmount
      RETURN
        connected.customerId AS networkMemberId,
        connected.firstName + ' ' + connected.lastName AS networkMemberName,
        connectionStrength,
        totalAmount,
        connected.createdAt AS accountOpenDate
      ORDER BY connectionStrength DESC, totalAmount DESC
      LIMIT 20

  ### 5. Velocity and Volume Analysis

  Transaction velocity analysis over time windows:

      MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: $customerId})-[:OWNS]->(a:Account)
      MATCH (a)-[t:TRANSACTION]->()
      WHERE t.timestamp >= datetime() - duration('P30D')
      WITH c, a, t,
          datetime.truncate('day', t.timestamp) AS day
      RETURN
        day,
        COUNT(t) AS transactionCount,
        SUM(t.amount) AS dailyVolume,
        AVG(t.amount) AS avgTransactionSize,
        MIN(t.amount) AS minTransaction,
        MAX(t.amount) AS maxTransaction
      ORDER BY day DESC

  ### 6. Geographic Anomalies

  Identify unusual transaction locations:

      MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: $customerId})-[:OWNS]->(a:Account)
      MATCH (c)-[:HAS_ADDRESS]->(addr:Address)
      MATCH (a)-[t:TRANSACTION]->()
      WHERE t.location IS NOT NULL
        AND t.timestamp >= datetime() - duration('P90D')
      WITH c, addr, t.location AS txLocation, COUNT(t) AS txCount, SUM(t.amount) AS totalAmount
      WHERE addr.state <> substring(txLocation, size(txLocation)-2, 2)
      RETURN
        txLocation,
        txCount,
        totalAmount,
        addr.state AS customerHomeState
      ORDER BY txCount DESC

  ### 7. Related Fraud Cases/Alerts

  Check if subject is linked to existing fraud investigations:

      MATCH (c:Customer {customerId: $customerId})
      OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:SUBJECT_OF]->(alert:Alert)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:SUBJECT_OF]->(case:Case)
      RETURN
        c.customerId,
        collect(DISTINCT {
          alertId: alert.alertId,
          type: alert.type,
          createdAt: alert.createdAt,
          status: alert.status
        }) AS relatedAlerts,
        collect(DISTINCT {
          caseId: case.caseId,
          type: case.type,
          createdAt: case.createdAt,
          status: case.status
        }) AS relatedCases

  - Authorized user abuse patterns

  ### Account Takeover Indicators:
  - Sudden changes to contact information
  - Rush requests for new cards or credentials
  - Large transfers immediately after credential changes
  - Access from unusual IP addresses or devices
  - Changes to beneficiaries or authorized users

  ### Money Laundering Indicators:
  - Structuring deposits to avoid CTR thresholds
  - Rapid movement of funds through multiple accounts
  - Transactions inconsistent with business purpose
  - Use of multiple accounts to fragment transactions
  - International wires with no clear business purpose

  ### Elder Financial Exploitation:
  - Sudden changes to account access or authorized users
